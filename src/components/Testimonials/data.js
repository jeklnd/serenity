        text: "The Island Handyman got the job done! Not only were they professional, always on-time, courteous and cleanly-conscience while in my home, they did exactly what they said they would do. The best part - no hidden fees. Robert was upfront with all fees and did not start anything until the price was approved. I had a list of items including installing a screen door, replacing door knobs, fixing broken light fixtures and rebuilding a very old attic exhaust fan. I will definitely be calling them again for any future needs.",

        text: "Robert is very professional and a good problem solver. Handyman projects often require thinking through a solution not just installing something. Robert listened to what we needed and researched then installed the perfect solution. This included a special door closer/attachment for our backdoor and a complete under the sink cabinet rolling shelf for a pretty heavy appliance. He also completed wall repairs and a bunch of other stuff. He was really efficient with his time as well.",

        text: "I needed several smaller repairs and some power washing done at my house. Trying to find a one-stop shop for plumbing, electrical, painting and exterior maintenance is difficult, but I found Robert and he does it all! And I mean HE does it all, so I knew the job would be done right by the owner. And it was. Robert not only did everything to my satisfaction but he is quiet, organized and cleans up. His rates are very reasonable also. I totally recommend him.",

He shared his expert opinion when I was uncertain about how to proceed on particular projects and even cleaned up after himself (which isn’t always the case with handymen). It was a pleasure working with him. The Island Handyman is aptly named. Stress-free home improvements, for sure!",
